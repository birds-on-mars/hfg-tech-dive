* Fantastic Algorithms and where to find them 
    * RunwayML collection ready to use
        * doesn't have all
        * not the latest
        * not full control
        * pretrained models 
        * need to pay for infrastructure
    * tools are distributed on github.com
        * github hosts git repositories
        * git organises code
        * keep track of versions
        * like saving a whole folder
        * puts it on server
        * automatic back-ups (if clever server)
        * other developers can pull and contribute
        * -> version control, back-up, distributed work
        * folders tracked by git are git repositories
    * access a git repository
        * by web front end
        * with git in terminal
        * web front end can download files
        * in terminal, also see history and updates etc
* StyleGAN
    * [StyleGAN landing page](https://nvlabs.github.io/stylegan2/versions.html)
    * repo with code, repo with data set
    * paper with explanation
    * video previews 
* Ingredients of a Machine Learning Algorithm
    * 3 parts: code, data set, model
    * code trains model or runs inference
    * use existing models: easy, maybe hack it?
    * train your own models: hard, but exclusive
* Where do I begin?
    * python
    * libraries, frameworks
    * hold a lot of well-tested code for typical tasks
    * in case of conflicting dependencies:
    * virtual environments
    * anaconda, virtualenv
    * activate, install/configure, deactivate 
* But really, how do I begin?
    * run scripts by typing `python generate_figures.py`
    * change run parameters with config file
    * or flags
    * `python pix2pix.py --mode train`
    * in any case, refer to the readme
    * or to blogs
    * [this blog](https://www.gwern.net/Faces) for StyleGAN
    * [this blog](https://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/) for pix2pix
* Did I already mention...?
    * everything in the command line
    * command line, bash, terminal, shell are kinda synonyms 
    * On Mac, you can open a terminal
    by using the spotlight (`Cmd+Space`)
    and typing in `terminal`
        * open a new
    terminal tab with `Cmd+T`
        * close current
    tab with `Cmd+W` an
        * close the terminal
    by typing `Cmd+Q`
    * On Ubuntu,
    you can open a terminal by typing
    `Ctrl+Alt+T`
        * open a new tab with 
    `Ctrl+Shift+T`
        * and close a tab by
    typing `exit` - this will also close
    the terminal, if the last tab is exited.
    * Sorry, no idea about Windows
* Why bother?
    * full control over scripts
    * easy data handling
    * but also: easy data corruption!
    * great power, great responsibility
    * not really necessary if your project
doesn't need in-depth control
