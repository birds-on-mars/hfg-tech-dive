## Fantastic Algorithms and where to find them 

Machine learning tools come in
various shapes and forms, and some
are available in a ready-to-use
package. [**RunwayML**](https://runwayml.com/) provides
a collection of such tools. Not all
current tools are available though and
some need to be paid for. To take full
control over the scripts you are using,
you can go directly to the source.

Most machine learning tools are
developed, updated and distributed
via github. **[github](https://github.com/)**
is a hosting service where you can
host **git repositories**. 

[**git**](https://git-scm.com/) is a software
that lets developers organise their code
base in a way that keeps track of different
versions of the code - it's like saving
the state of a whole directory, so you can
restore previous versions of your project.
git doesn't store the files on your computer
alone, but puts them on a server where the
server can handle back-ups and where other
developers can pull the newest version of
the project or push their addition to the
project to. git is **version control**, **back-up**,
and **collaborative workspace** all in one.
A folder that is tracked by git is called 
a **git repository**.

A git repository hosted on github can be
accessed either by the web front end through
your browser or by the git software, usually
from the terminal. From the website, you can
download the files and run the script. If
you instead use git to access the repository,
you also get the project history, different
versions and updates in the future.

Install git following these 
[instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## StyleGAN

Let's have a look at the 
[StyleGAN landing page](https://nvlabs.github.io/stylegan2/versions.html).
It links to a github-repo with the code
as well as to a repo with the *data set*
plus a scientific paper explaining the
algorithm from a conceptual point of
view. The video previews can give you
an indication about whether this algorithm
is useful for your project or not.

## Ingredients of a Machine Learning Algorithm

A ml-algorithm usually consists of three parts:
the code, the data set, and the model. The code
either uses the data set to train the model or
it uses a model to make the model do what it
was trained for. You can either use an existing
model for your project, which is rather easy.
Interesting results can be achieved by using
the model in an unintended way, by hacking the
model. Or you can train your own model, which
is rather hard but gives you deeper control
over how the model will integrate into your
project.

## Where do I begin?

Now you have access to a script that looks
promising. How do you start it? Most algorithms
are written in a programming language called
`python`.
