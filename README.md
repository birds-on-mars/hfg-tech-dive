Most machine learning tools are
developed, maintained and distributed
via github. **[github](https://github.com/)**
is a hosting service where you can
host **git repositories**. 

[**git**](https://git-scm.com/) is a software
that lets developers organise their code
base in a way that keeps track of different
versions of the code - it's like saving
the state of a whole directory, so you can
restore previous versions of your project.
git doesn't store the files on your computer
alone, but puts them on a server where the
server can handle back-ups and where other
developers can pull the newest version of
the project or push their addition to the
project to. git is version control, back-up,
and collaborative workspace all in one.
